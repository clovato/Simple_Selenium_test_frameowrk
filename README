Simple Python Browser Testing Framework README
=====================
you should first make sure you have python and pip installed on your system

then you will first need to install all requirements(remove sudo if in windows):

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

once all requirements are installed make sure to cd into the 'experticity' directory

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ cd experticity

Now you should be able to run the test using the python nose test-runner

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ nosetests -v -s test_signup.py

if you get an error that says you need to install chromedriver
then you can follow instructions on how to do that or go into the "sys_config.ini"
file and change the "browser" to firefox
